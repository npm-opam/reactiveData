===== 0.2 =====

  * Add `from_signal`, which converts React signals to ReactiveData
    containers. `from_signal` uses a diffing algorithm to detect what
    changes, thus minimizing the updates needed downstream.
  * Optimize common cases of `merge`.
  * Provide documentation and make the naming more consistent.

===== 0.1 ======

  * First public release
